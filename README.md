# ㆔ Ethernal Contract
Ethernal is a lightweight cross-chain bridge designed for seamless token transfers between chains. The tokens to bridge are built-in with a vault strategy, allowing users to passively yield rewards from the source chain and automatically distribute those yields to the destination chain. Ethernal has a low maintenance cost and most security with multi-signature message proof provided by xOracle.
